Here are the hallmarks of this commit:
1) The following two endpoints were implemented by Muhammed all the way from controller to service to dao: "/addtocart", "/removefromcart"
   The following endpoints  were implementd by Hassan all the way from controller to service to dao as well:
	"/welcomeToCommerce": Dante, team lead, proposed we think about this endpoint and return the cart of the authenticated shopper rather than just printing a welcome message
	"/savecart": this is a redundant route that is used as a litmus test for e2e testing
	"/checkoutcart": this route is included in the contract

2) To test the controller of the commerce layers, I wrote e2e tests using RestTemplate class as a Java-based replacement to e2e testing using postman.
-- Endpoints passing the e2e testing:
   "/welcomeToCommerce", "/savecart" by two different testing methods, "/checkoutcart"
-- Endpoints failing the e2e testing:
   "/addtocart", "/removefromcart"
   Both endpoints returned 500 internal server error by just hitting the endpoint.
   Muhammed or whomever the team elects needs to troubleshoot these two endpoint throughout all the layers and make sure these
   endpoint passes the provided e2e method without any internal server errors.


3) Recommended resources: you can read more about e2e testing and RestTemplate here

4) To the service layer, Muhammed wrote two tests for the following two methods under CartServiceUnitTests in the service test folder
   updateCart(), removeItemFromCart()
   Both unit tests passed which is in disagreement with the 500 internal server errors faced with e2e testing the two corresponding endpoints
   as indicated above. This discrepancy needs to be resolved.
