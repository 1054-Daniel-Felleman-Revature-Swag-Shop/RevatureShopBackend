Here are the hallmarks of this commit:
1) Commerce endpoint /saveCart was implemented in CartController and CartService using the save() method of CartRepository.
2) A different unit testing strategy is introduced under test/java/com.revature.shop.commerce/CartControllerUnitTests 
3) The name of the unit testing strategy introduced earlier was changed from CartService to CartServiceTests under the same package.
