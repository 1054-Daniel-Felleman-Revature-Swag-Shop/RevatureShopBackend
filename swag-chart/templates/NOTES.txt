This helm chart requires the cluster on which it is installed
to have an Nginx based Ingress controller.

All cloud providers have a different way of installing this.

Features of this chart include:
Set the images and tags for each deployment:
-- helm install release-name swag-chart --set accounts.image=my-image --set commerce.tag=my-tag
-- helm install release-name swag-chart --set inventory.image=another-image-name

Set Resource limits and requirements for individual pods:
-- helm install release-name swag-chart --set accounts.memoryLimit=500Mi --set  eureka.cpuRequest=500M

Allows deployment via NGINX Ingress as well as via Spring-Gateway-Service:
-- helm install release-name swag-chart --set ingress.useIngress=false ((This will expose the gateway via the Ingress IP))
NOTE: By default Ingress is used.

Set Domain name (provided a domain has an A record which points to ingress' IP):
-- helm install release-name swag-chart --set ingress.useHost=true ingress.host=my-domain.com
NOTE: By default this chart does not use a host name, and only exposes itself via the Ingress Controller's IP.
